# Population-Evolution-Simulator
A simulation of biological evolution using selection by traits caused by environmental factors. Shows an example of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For AP Bio extra credit! 

# Results

- A demonstration of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [Static Conditions](Tests in Static Conditions)
- A demonstration of evolution between different traits with different death rates [Evolution](Tests with Evolution)
