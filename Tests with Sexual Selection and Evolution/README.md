 # Interpretation

I pitted the forces of sexual selection and evolution against one another. Although it is detrimental for Individuals to have the "Crazy Color" trait, they get mating partners because it is a desirable trait. A real-life example of this is a deer's antlers which can grow ridiculuously long but actually harm the survival of the individual. However, they are a desirable trait for mating, so the trait still exists in populations.
